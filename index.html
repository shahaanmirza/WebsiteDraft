        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a sophomore (2nd year) at the Illinois Institute of Technology pursuing a Bachelor
            of Science in Information Technology and Management. I am planning on potentially
            minoring in pre-law and political science. I am extremely involved on campus and hold
            multiple positions of leadership in several student organizations. In my free time I
            like to stay active and enjoy exploring the many neighborhoods in Chicago. I also enjoy
            reading self-help books to better myself, and I have an interest in philosophy, politics
            and business. Beyond my personal life, I am interested in venture capital, financial
            technology and investment consulting.
